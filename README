GlBlox - Rendering experiments
==============================

Description
-----------

GlBlox is an OpenGL volume renderer that draws volumes as a blocky mesh.


Details
-------

* Core rendering engine implemented in C++ with a Python wrapper for prototyping.
* Uses the Pyglet Python module to provide OpenGL window manager and input
* Generate volumes using heightmaps, perlin noise or simple procedures.

Features implemented
--------------------

* Volume storage classes, volume loading and volume modification.
* Mesh generators for optimised or standard 'blocky' meshes.
* Quaternion based freelook camera and mouse controls.
* Frustrum culling.
* Back-face culling.
* Block shading using colourmaps (GLSL)

Features to add
---------------

* Collision detection.
* Volume storage and loading with compression + memory optimisations.
* Block picking and volume modification.
* Paging for loading large worlds.
